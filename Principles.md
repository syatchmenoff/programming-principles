Principles of Legit Programming
===============================

Code Fearlessly
---------------
Work in a safe development environment.  
Commit early and often.  
You can always roll back mistakes.  
Do the right thing.  


Code Functionally
-----------------
Whenever possible, code in a pure functional style.  
Inputs in, outputs out, no side effects.  
If you can't make this work, you are probably doing something wrong.
